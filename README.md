# Java-Projects
- A collection of my Java projects created in AP Computer Science A! As of March 2025, all of the below projects are from [Project STEM](https://projectstem.org), however I am currently working on individual projects I will add soon.

## [Array Statistics](https://github.com/cole-dobmeier/Array-Statistics.git)
- Array statistics is a project that is all about using Array, and array methods to manipulate data and store information about a student body. This project involves many methods such as averageGpa, getGpaRange, getLongestName, and a search method based off of GPA's. Attached is a runner file and a file that will store the statistics about the students. This project was a perfect introduction to arrays, and we are currently working on ArrayLists, and 2D Arrays.

## [String Shortener](https://github.com/cole-dobmeier/String-Shortener.git)
- This project is one I struggled with at first but it was a crucial learning tool to understand the basics of string-concatenation. The program is meant to imitate the shortened messages you used to have to tweet when there was a much smaller character limit - SMS messages had a character limit of 160, and Twitter debuted with 140 characters.
  - The first algorithm creates a string from the message in which every vowel (a, e, i, o, and u) is removed unless the vowel is at the very start of a word. Every repeated non-vowel  is also removed from the new string. So for example the string "I will arrive in Mississippi really soon" becomes "i wl arv in mssp rly sn".
  - The second algorithm creates a string by taking each unique character in the message in the order they first appear and putting that letter and the number of times it appears in the original message into the shortened string. For example, the string "I will arrive in Mississippi really soon" becomes "8i1w4l2a3r1v2e2n1m5s2p1y2o".

## [Player Game](https://github.com/cole-dobmeier/Player-Class.git)
- This java project imitates a 3 dimensional game where you can create defualt or custom players using the constructors, attack other characters, teleport to coordinates/players, along with getting the distance between you and a point or another character. This project helped to develop my understanding of constructors and creating methods in order to make an interactive program.
